  
Process Notes for React Shopping List
============================================




About Process Notes
===================
"Process Notes" is a step-by-step workflow document that outlines the "phases" of my study/app development and the successive steps taken at each
milestone of the examination. In the case of studies, the process notes might be eschewed in favor of the main Readme document in the repository, 
mostly because of the advantage in formatting and accessibility. However, I will put additional notes and resource links that might be helpful. In 
the case of application development, groups of related steps are combined into "phase" modules so that they can be reorganized and refined in 
post-review. This has proven to be EXTREMELY helpful in learning (i.e. Feynman technique (https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)) and refining 
workflow so I can improve my process in future projects. It also has come in handy for some tricky bug fixes not only for past projects, but this 
one as well so I would urge you to consider at least doing a rough summary for your own benefit.



Objective of Study
==================
Create a shopping list app in React that utilizes callback props to pass state between components. 

This shopping list app is going to cover the issues associated with updating the shopping list itself and utilizing callback props. Specifically
we'll tackle updating the state of the component in practice and utilizing callback props. This is going to cover planning and project setup as 
well so that the workflow can be refined for the next project.




Project outline
================
This is going to be a basic shopping list application, so the most essential thing the app is going to need is an input field, and submission button, and
a list of the items that have been added. Each item will be listed and will have option of checking or deleting it.

Basic Wireframe
=========================================
[Title of Application]
[Input Field] [Add Item Button]
[Item 1][Check][Delete]
[Item 2][Check][Delete]
[Item 3][Check][Delete]

Basic Wireframe (broken up into components)
===========================================
---------------------------------------        1. App component -- "App"
[Title of Application]                 |   
[Input Field] [Add Item Button]        |       2. Add item component -- "AddItemForm"  
[Item 1][Check][Delete]                |       3. Shopping list -- "ShoppingList"
[Item 2][Check][Delete]                |       4. Sopping item -- "ShoppingItem"
[Item 3][Check][Delete]                |
